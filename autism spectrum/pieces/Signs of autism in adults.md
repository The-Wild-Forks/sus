Signs of autism in adults  
Main signs of autism  
Common signs of autism in adults include:  
finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling  
getting very anxious about social situations  
finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on your own  
seeming blunt, rude or not interested in others without meaning to  
finding it hard to say how you feel  
taking things very literally – for example, you may not understand sarcasm or phrases like "break a leg"  
having the same routine every day and getting very anxious if it changes  
Other signs of autism  
You may also have other signs, like:  
not understanding social "rules", such as not talking over people  
avoiding eye contact  
getting too close to other people, or getting very upset if someone touches or gets too close to you  
noticing small details, patterns, smells or sounds that others do not  
having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities  
liking to plan things carefully before doing them  
Autism in women  
Autistic women may be more likely to:  
have learned to hide signs of autism to 'fit in' \- by copying people who do not have autism  
be quieter and hide their feelings  
appear to cope better with social situations  
show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours  
This means it can be harder to tell you're autistic if you're a woman.  
The National Autistic Society have more information about autistic women and girls  
Non-urgent advice:  
See a GP if:  
you think you may be autistic  
If you already see a health professional, such as another doctor or therapist, you could speak to them instead.  
Getting diagnosed can help you get any extra support you might need.

Signs of autism in children  
Autism in young children  
Signs of autism in young children include:  
not responding to their name  
avoiding eye contact  
not smiling when you smile at them  
getting very upset if they do not like a certain taste, smell or sound  
repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands, flicking their fingers or rocking their body  
not talking as much as other children  
not doing as much pretend play  
repeating the same phrases  
Autism in older children  
Signs of autism in older children include:

unusual speech, such as repeating phrases and talking ‘at’ others  
liking a strict daily routine and getting very upset if it changes  
having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities

Autism in girls and boys  
Autism can sometimes be different in girls and boys.  
Autistic girls may:  
hide some signs of autism by copying how other children behave and play  
withdraw in situations they find difficult  
appear to cope better with social situations  
show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours  
This means autism can be harder to spot in girls.  
The National Autistic Society has more information about autistic women and girls

 Getting diagnosed as autistic  
How to get an autism assessment  
1\. Talk to someone for advice  
If you think you or your child have signs of autism, the next step is to talk to someone about it.  
You could speak to:  
a GP  
a health visitor (for children under 5\)  
any other health professional you or your child see, such as another doctor or therapist  
special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school  
Ask them about referring you or your child for an autism assessment.  
An assessment is done by autism specialists. It's the only way to find out if you or your child are autistic.  
Tips for when you speak to someone  
Do  
write a list of the signs of autism you think you or your child have and bring it with you  
ask people who know you or your child well (like friends, family or teachers) if they have noticed any possible signs you could put on your list  
bring a pen and paper so you can take notes  
bring your child or someone who knows you well with you, if you think it might help (you do not have to)  
Don’t  
try not to talk too much about other things – autism should be the main thing you talk about  
2\. Have an autism assessment  
An autism assessment is where a team of autism specialists check if you or your child are autistic.  
An assessment team may:  
ask about any problems you or your child are having  
watch how you or your child interact with other people  
speak to people who know you or your child well, such as family, friends, your GP or your child's teachers  
At the end of the assessment, you'll be given a report saying if you or your child are autistic.  
Find out what happens during an autism assessment  
How a diagnosis can help  
Parents and children  
For parents and children, a diagnosis can help you:  
understand your child's needs and how you can help your child  
get advice about support for your child at school  
get support for parents and carers of autistic people, such as financial benefits  
understand that your child is not just being "naughty" or "difficult"  
Adults  
For adults, a diagnosis can help you:  
understand why you might find some things harder than other people  
explain to others why you see and feel the world in a different way  
get support at college, university or work  
get some financial benefits  
If you find it hard to get an assessment  
It's not always easy to get an autism assessment. Waiting times can also be very long.  
If you're finding it hard to get an assessment, you could ask to speak to someone else, like another GP – this is called getting a second opinion.  
It may also help to speak to other people who have been in a similar situation.

How to get an autism assessment  
You need to be referred for an assessment by someone such as a GP or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school.  
You may have to wait a few months to get an appointment.  
Find out how to get diagnosed  
What you can do while you wait for an assessment  
If you think you or your child need support at school, home or at work, you can start getting help before having an assessment.  
You can:  
ask a GP if the assessment team can suggest any support groups  
ask a GP to refer your child for speech and language therapy  
find a local support group using the National Autistic Society services directory  
talk to teachers or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school  
speak to student support services at college or university  
speak to your manager or human resources at work  
ask your local council for a needs assessment to see what support they can recommend  
What happens during an autism assessment  
You or your child may have 1 or more appointments with a team of different professionals.  
For children  
The assessment team may:  
ask you about your child's development, such as when they started talking  
watch how you and your child interact, and how your child plays  
read any reports sent by their GP, nursery or school  
ask about their medical history and do a physical examination  
A member of the team may also visit your child's school to watch them in class and at break time.  
For adults  
The assessment team may:  
ask you to fill in a questionnaire about yourself and any problems you have  
speak to someone who knew you as a child to find out about your childhood  
read any reports from the GP about other health problems you may have  
Getting the result  
When the assessment is finished, you'll be given a report saying what the team found.  
You may be given it by the team or get it in the post.  
The report will say:  
if you or your child are autistic – it might say something like you "meet the criteria for autism spectrum diagnosis"  
what you or your child might need help with – such as social interaction, communication, behaviours or sensitivity to lights, colours and sounds  
what you or your child are good at  
Sometimes the report can be hard to understand as it can be full of terms used by healthcare professionals.  
Ask the assessment team if you need any help.  
You and your child should also be offered another appointment a few weeks or months later, to talk to someone from the assessment team about the report.  
Autism is a lifelong condition, so the report will be used throughout childhood and into adulthood.  
If you do not agree with the result  
When you get the report, you may:  
be told you or your child are not autistic  
be asked to wait until your child is a bit older to be assessed again, as the signs of autism may not be clear  
be given a diagnosis you do not agree with, such as a learning disability  
Ask the assessment team why they have made the diagnosis they have.  
The assessment team might arrange for a second opinion from a different team.  
If you still do not agree, you can ask the GP to refer you to another team for a second opinion. Or you can pay for another assessment by a professional you choose who works outside the NHS (privately).  
Remember that a second opinion may say the same thing.

Common types of behaviour in autistic children  
Some autistic children may behave in ways that put a lot of strain on you and your family.  
Some common autistic behaviours are:  
stimming (short for 'self-stimulating behaviour'), a kind of repetitive behaviour  
meltdowns, a complete loss of control over behaviour  
You may hear health professionals call some behaviours "challenging".  
Some autistic children can also be physically or verbally aggressive. Their behaviour can be harmful to themselves or other people.  
But remember, all autistic children are different and not every day will be challenging or stressful.  
Ambitious about Autism has more information about behaviours that challenge  
Why these behaviours happen  
Many autistic children use a set of behaviours to help them manage their emotions and make sense of their environment. Sometimes they're done for enjoyment.  
Some things that can be linked to these behaviours include:  
being over- or under-sensitive to things like bright lights, noises, touch or pain  
anxiety, especially when routines suddenly change  
not being able to make sense of what's going on around them  
being unwell or in pain  
These behaviours are not your or your child's fault.  
Stimming  
Stimming is a kind of repetitive behaviour.  
Common stimming behaviours include:  
rocking, jumping, spinning, head-banging  
hand-flapping, finger-flicking, flicking rubber bands  
repeating words, phrases or sounds  
staring at lights or spinning objects  
Stimming is usually harmless. It may look odd to others, but you should not try to stop it if it's not causing any harm to you or your child.  
Ambitious about Autism has more on repetitive behaviours and stimming  
Meltdowns  
Meltdowns are a complete loss of control caused by being totally overwhelmed.  
If your child has a meltdown, the most important thing is to try to stay calm and keep them safe.  
If you're worried your child might hurt themselves or others, try to hold them to keep them safe.  
It's not always possible to prevent meltdowns, but there are some things you can do that may help at an early stage.  
These include:  
letting your child wear headphones to listen to calming music  
turning down or removing bright lights  
distraction techniques, such as fiddle toys  
planning ahead for any change in routine, such as a different route to school  
It may help to keep a diary for a few weeks to see if you can spot any meltdown triggers that you can do something about.  
The National Autistic Society has more on meltdowns  
Non-urgent advice:  
Speak to the autism care team or a GP if your child is:  
stimming all the time or having lots of meltdowns  
being bullied at school because of their behaviour  
aggressive, harming themselves or harming other people  
If you're struggling to cope, your child may be referred for professional support.

Autism is not an illness  
Being autistic does not mean you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works in a different way from other people.  
It's something you're born with. Signs of autism might be noticed when you're very young, or not until you're older.  
If you're autistic, you're autistic your whole life.  
Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a "cure". But some people need support to help them with certain things.  
Autistic people can live a full life  
Being autistic does not have to stop you having a good life.  
Like everyone, autistic people have things they're good at as well as things they struggle with.  
Being autistic does not mean you can never make friends, have relationships or get a job. But you might need extra help with these things.  
Autism is different for everyone  
Autism is a spectrum. This means everybody with autism is different.  
Some autistic people need little or no support. Others may need help from a parent or carer every day.  
Some people use other names for autism  
There are other names for autism used by some people, such as:  
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the medical name for autism  
Asperger's (or Asperger syndrome) is used by some people to describe autistic people with average or above average intelligence  
More about Asperger's  
It's not clear what causes autism  
Nobody knows what causes autism, or if it has a cause.  
It can affect people in the same family. So it may sometimes be passed on to a child by their parents.  
Autism is:  
not caused by bad parenting  
not caused by vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine  
not linked to diet  
not an infection you can spread to other people  
Autistic people can have any level of intelligence  
Some autistic people have average or above average intelligence.  
Some autistic people have a learning disability. This means they may find it hard to look after themselves and need help with daily life.  
Autistic people may have other conditions  
Autistic people often have other conditions, such as:  
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  
dyslexia  
anxiety  
depression  
epilepsy

ADHD in adults  
ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a condition where the brain works differently to most people. If you have ADHD, you may have trouble with things like concentrating and sitting still. There are things you can do to help manage your symptoms.  
Information:  
There is separate information about ADHD in children and young people.  
Symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)  
Symptoms of ADHD involve your ability to pay attention to things (being inattentive), having high energy levels (being hyperactive) and your ability to control your impulses (being impulsive).  
You may show signs of being inattentive, such as:  
being easily distracted or forgetful  
finding it hard to organise your time  
finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks  
losing things often, like your wallet, mobile or keys  
You may show signs of being hyperactive and impulsive, including:  
having a lot of energy or feeling restless  
being very talkative or interrupting conversations  
making quick decisions without thinking about what might happen as a result  
Most people with ADHD will have symptoms of both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive type. Some only show signs of one type.  
These symptoms usually start before the age of 12\.  
ADHD is thought to be recognised less often in women than men. This may be because women with ADHD more commonly have inattentive symptoms and these can be harder to recognise than hyperactive symptoms.  
Getting help with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)  
If your ADHD symptoms are affecting your studies, work or relationships, make an appointment with a GP to find out what support is available.  
At your appointment, the GP will ask about your symptoms and how they affect your life. They may also want to consider other conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as autism, Tourette's or anxiety, to help you get the right care.  
After the appointment, the GP may decide to refer you for an assessment with a mental health professional specialising in ADHD.  
If you have already been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and need help for your symptoms, talk to your GP about getting a referral.  
People with ADHD may often have other conditions too, such as depression, anxiety or addictions, or a learning difficulty such as dyslexia.  
What happens at an ADHD assessment  
Your appointment will be with an ADHD specialist such as a psychiatrist.  
They’ll ask about the history of your symptoms, particularly if they started when you were a child, and how these symptoms affected you at school.  
The assessment will focus on different areas of your life, including:  
work and education  
family and friends  
medical history, including any mental health issues  
The specialist may want to contact someone who knows you well, such as a family member or close friend.  
If you’re diagnosed with ADHD, the specialist will talk to you about what this means and what will happen next, including what help and support may be available.  
Information:  
Waiting times for ADHD assessments  
Waiting times vary and you may have to wait several months or years to access ADHD specialist services.  
You may be able to find a clinic with shorter waiting lists through your GP using the Right to Choose scheme. Read about Right to Choose and your choices in the NHS.  
You can ask for an NHS appointment at any clinic, including a private clinic, if it provides ADHD services for the NHS in England.  
Find out more about diagnosis pathways for adults on the ADHD UK website.  
How to manage ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)  
ADHD can be managed in many ways, including lifestyle changes, changes at work, or medicines.  
It depends on your symptoms and how they're affecting you. Not everyone needs or wants to take medicine to help manage their ADHD symptoms.  
When you get a diagnosis of ADHD, your specialist will discuss ways you can be supported.  
Lifestyle  
There are things you can do to help yourself.  
Make time for physical activities you enjoy, as exercise has many health benefits and can be a good focus for your energy.  
Exercise also helps reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression can make your ADHD symptoms worse.  
It’s important to get enough sleep. Having a regular bedtime and a quiet dark bedroom can help. Try to avoid screens, caffeine, sugar and alcohol close to bedtime.  
Aim for a healthy, balanced diet and regular mealtimes.  
You may also find it helpful to talk to friends and family about your ADHD.  
Work, college or university  
At your workplace or place of study, you can request changes to help you manage your ADHD. These are called “reasonable adjustments”.  
Reasonable adjustments may include things like:  
having a personalised work space in a quiet area  
having written instructions as well as spoken instructions  
having help from another person to plan and structure your tasks  
You can read more about workplace adjustments and other ways to help ADHD on the ADHD UK website.  
Medicines  
ADHD medicines must be started and monitored by an ADHD specialist.  
Medicines that can help with ADHD symptoms include methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine.  
You may need to try more than one medicine to find out what works for you.  
A GP may be able to take over prescribing ADHD medicines, but only if there is a “shared care agreement” between the GP and the ADHD specialist. To find out more, talk to your ADHD specialist or GP.  
Talking therapies  
Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness, may be recommended for adults with ADHD.  
Information:  
ADHD and driving  
You must tell the DVLA if your driving is affected by your ADHD or your ADHD medicine, or both.  
Find out more about ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and driving on GOV.UK  
ADHD and mental health  
People with ADHD may be more likely to have a mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.  
They are also at higher risk of suicide.  
If you're feeling like you want to end your life, it's important to tell someone.  
Help and support is available right now if you need it. You do not have to struggle with difficult feelings alone.  
Find out how to get help for suicidal thoughts.   
What causes ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)  
The cause of ADHD is not always known. ADHD may be caused by genetic differences and often runs in families.  
There are several other things linked to ADHD, including being born premature (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), having epilepsy, a brain injury and being autistic.  
Some people with ADHD call themselves neurodivergent. Neurodiversity describes the range of different ways our brains work.  
Help and support for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)  
If you have ADHD, there are ways to help manage your condition in addition to support from your doctor and workplace.  
There are ADHD support groups locally and online.  
There are also a number of organisations and charities that can offer information and support about ADHD.
