# Adult Autism & ADHD Assessment Tool

## Introduction
This assessment tool is designed to evaluate symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult females. This is not a definitive diagnostic tool but can help identify patterns that may warrant professional evaluation.

## Instructions

- Be honest in your responses; there are no right or wrong answers
- After completing the assessment, total your scores in each section

## Rating Scale
For each statement, select the option that best describes your experience:
- 0 = Never/Rarely
- 1 = Sometimes
- 2 = Often
- 3 = Very Often/Almost Always

## Important Notes

1. **This is not a clinical diagnosis.** A comprehensive evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional is necessary for diagnosis.

2. **Female presentation** of autism and ADHD often differs from the traditional male presentation used to develop diagnostic criteria.

3. **Co-occurrence is common.** Autism and ADHD frequently co-exist, with overlapping symptoms.

4. **Masking** (consciously or unconsciously hiding symptoms) is common in women, making diagnosis more challenging.

5. **Late diagnosis** is common for women, especially those with average or above-average intelligence who have developed coping strategies.

6. **Next steps:** If your scores indicate significant traits, consider sharing these results with a healthcare provider specializing in adult neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Recommendations

If your scores suggest significant autistic or ADHD traits:

1. **Seek professional assessment** from a clinician experienced with adult autism/ADHD in women

2. **Learn more** about autism and/or ADHD through reputable sources

3. **Connect with community** through support groups or online forums

4. **Explore accommodations** that might help with challenging areas

5. **Practice self-compassion** as you learn more about your neurotype
